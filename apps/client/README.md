# Run the front-end

To run the client-side, first, you need to go into this folder `client` with your terminal(cmd).

Now that you're inside this folder.

- Run this command : `npm i` to install all the dependencies
- Run this command : `npm run dev` to run the app locally and go to `http://localhost:3000` to go to the app
- Voila ! You launched the front-end
