# Apps folder

This folder contains the front-end(`client`) and the back-end(`server`).

# Tip

Inside each folder, there's an explanation on how to run each side. However, I don't recommend you to try to run each side manually as you may struggle to make it work (especially for the `server` side), it requires a PostgreSQL database and you might have some problems setting it up.
